		<p>Father of four and husband looking to gain more knowledge to become a kickass webdeveloper one day. Just graduated with a degree in Computer Science but, I consider myself a novice as far as web development is concerned. So here I am trying get my web techecnology certification from HES and hopefully it will do my resume some good. I'm an avid gamer who loves cooking, biking, working out. But I don't work-out as much as I should (since getting married). When the wife and I have time we enjoy stepping out on the town and acting like we are in our twenties again.</p>
