		<p>Father of four and husband looking to gain more knowledge to become a kickass webdeveloper one day. Just graduated with a degree in Computer Science but I feel that wasn't enough. So here I am trying get my web techecnology certification from HES and hopefully it will do my resume some good. I'm an avid gamer who loves cooking, biking, working out. But I don't go as much as I should (since getting married). And of course going out on the town with the Ole Lady.</p>
